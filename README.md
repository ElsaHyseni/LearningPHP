# LearningPHP
Learning the basics of PHP, MySql

When working with PDO I learned to include the DSN, host, dbname, root, password and additional options (if it runs in any error).
Learned to prepare and execute the statement and fetch data from my database.

*Used an additional file for configuration for security reasons.
